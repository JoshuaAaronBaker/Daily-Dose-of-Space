# Daily-Dose-of-Space

A dynamic web app for people interested in getting daily glimpses into space.

## Why I Built This

I've always been fascinated with space and I am always looking for more interesting things to learn
about the vast unkown. So working with an api that provides daily images from NASA allowed me to be
exposed to new peices of information, which becomes the springboard for further research.
